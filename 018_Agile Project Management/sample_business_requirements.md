# Title
Sunday School Check-In App

## Executive Summary
This document is meant to inform, guide and promote inspiration for all working in this project! This project is about the saftey of our community and to give security to all who are in direct contact with our creation.

## Business Objectives

This project is very important in the sense that it will be used by over hundreds of families that attend the church over many services a week. They trust us taking care of and teaching their children, and we want to reach back with extra comfort and a sense of security that their children is well taken care of. Our objectives for this project are to create a fully functional check-in and check-out app that will keep profiles of kids storing information such as allergies, parents, and dates of brith. This information should be in a database and be accessable for viewing in an easy to understand system guarded by a password. 

## Background
With the amount of services and children coming to Sunday School, we are finding a need for some kind of check in and check out system. One that will not only be used by the staff at church but also by the parents for updates on services and whether or not childcare can be provided! This way, we have a uniform platform that we can work off of and help keep our kids safe with ease. This project could not only enhance the church experience for a single church but could also be opened up to multiple churches around the country. 

## Scope

The vision for this is a mobile hybrid app, most likely via Ionic Cordova that will be used for android, but mainly for iOS due to the fact iOS is more commonly used for other parts of the Sunday School. We will be needing a database for this project so we can store attendance records for the kids for auditing purposes. This database should also come with a front end display for higher security level users that is password protected. We should be able to sign new children up or visitor children (lighter profile) on one easy screen. We should be able to have search parameters for kids with existing profiles that are available.

## Functional requirements

Functional- 
Database, for storing and maintaining records of attendance, kids information, allergies and security information pertaining to parents/guardians. We should be able to run this on multiple devices need be so there should be a cloud storage for this db so any device with the app can load up the information. This data should be password protected and only available for those who have been granted access to it. A comprehensive form signup for new kids being registered. This sign up process should take no longer than a minute. We can gather all other child details via a handwritten form we give to the parents and then input the values later. Name, Age, Parents/Guardians, and Allergy/Medication info is all that should initally be needed. IF the parents would like, we can also take a photo of the family to add another level of personal touch and visual identification. Photo can be taken by device via plugin. The app should be able to check in students with a timestamp, and do the same for check outs. Possibly assign childIds for record keeping. Adding notes to profiles for important information.

UX - 
A sleek and simplisting approach to effective navigation and informative screens. The feel should be fast-paced as the check in process can sometimes hold up other kids from being checked in. The design should be light and inspire brightness and a feeling of ease. The whole sign in process should be so simple, older volunteers or staff should be able to use it. 


## Personnel requirements

Since this app is not too wildy large, we should be able to keep production down to two or 3 
*In this section you may want to describe the composition of the team, do you need dedicated development?  how many people?  How about design or QA?  Think about what personnel is required to make this project a success, and place your recommendations here.*

## Delivery schedule

No schedule as far as date/time but order of events listed: 

1) Meeting with staff to determine possible uses, problems, address questions and gather locally sourced input for app features and feel. 
2) Meeting with Pastoral staff and supplementary staff for insight into app as well. 
3) Project Management & Layout - determining timeframes and project steps in an organized fashion. 
4) Database Development 
5) Basic Structural Development Stage - ensure app parameters are met as far as pages and directory. 
6) Implement functionallity processes. Check in, check out, testing with database. 
7) Full Database integration and functionality checks. 
8) UX and UI styling and finalizing. 
9) Testing Phase & any modifications, team review, volunteer review and staff review. UX rating (anon) and suggestions meeting.
10) Release App into wild
11) scale and generalize for other churches to use.
12) Implement other features as time goes on, features tbd depending on needs. 

## Other requirements

none other than listed. hybrid app compatable with iOS, Android and Windows phones. Smart phones/devices only. lightweight as easy to use. 

## Assumptions

Cordova plug ins for SQL database, some kind of calendar plug in, camera plug in. The app would be built in Ionic Cordova to keep the designing process and structure light. as stated this is a hybrid app. additional design and content will be reviewed as presented after main goals are verified to be on pace or completed. 

## Limitations

Due to the nature of this app, the team will be limited in resources and time as we do not employee full-time programmers and developers. The application will have to be light but effective given the subject matter of the app. There are really no time constrains but this project should be completed as soon as possible.

## Risks

Database integration and the size of the database. User errors resulting in creating multiple files for the same children. User errors with checking in and out kids. Add verification checks to before checking out kids, ensure that parent(s) are with the child upon checkin.out times. Constant check ups on security side files, making sure that we arent doubling up the same profiles. No major financial loss associated with app production.
